# Django-CRUD-Connectivity-Demo-HTML-CSS-Bootstrap-Frontend
This repository contains a lightweight Django app backed by simple models and views, plus static frontend pages (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) used to render and demonstrate how the frontend and backend communicate. The focus is educational: show how to wire templates to views, handle forms, submit and validate data, and perform CRUD operations from a Bootstrap-styled UI.

Features

Django backend with one or more example models (e.g., Item, Post, Contact).

Full CRUD flows: create, list, detail, update, delete.

Responsive frontend built with HTML, custom CSS, and Bootstrap components.
